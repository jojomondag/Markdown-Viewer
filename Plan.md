# Markdown Viewer Implementation Checklist

Markdown Viewer and Editor Application Specification
Overview
Create a modern Markdown viewer and editor application with real-time preview capabilities, two-way file synchronization, and an intuitive file navigation system. The application should be built using Skeleton UI, Tailwind CSS, and Tabler icons.
Core Features
1. File System Integration

Implement two-way communication between local files and the application
Auto-save changes to disk when editing markdown content
Watch for external file changes and refresh the application accordingly

2. Navigation System

Create a collapsible sidebar for file navigation
Implement a recursive file explorer that can:

Display folder hierarchies (with proper indentation)
Show markdown files within each folder
Allow expanding/collapsing folders
Handle deep nested directory structures efficiently



3. File Preview and Editing

Split-pane view with markdown source on one side and rendered preview on the other
Real-time preview that updates as you type
Syntax highlighting for markdown source
Support for common markdown extensions (tables, code blocks, etc.)
Editor enhancements like line numbers and search/replace functionality

4. Syntax Tree Management

Create a visual representation of the document structure (headers, sections, etc.)
Allow users to navigate through documents using the syntax tree
Implement syntax tree presets that can be saved and loaded
Group preset management in a tabbed interface on the sidebar

UI/UX Requirements
Layout

Responsive design that works well on various screen sizes
Collapsible sidebar with file explorer and syntax tree tabs
Adjustable split between editor and preview panes
Dark/light theme support (using Skeleton UI theming)

Components

Use Skeleton UI components for consistent design
Implement Skeleton tabs for switching between file navigation and syntax tree views
Use Tabler icons from GitHub repository
Properly styled markdown rendering with Tailwind CSS

User Interactions

Drag and drop file/folder support
Context menus for file operations (rename, delete, etc.)
Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
Smooth transitions and animations for UI interactions

Technical Requirements
Technologies

Frontend Framework: Choose an appropriate framework (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.)
UI Library: Skeleton UI
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Icons: Tabler Icons
Markdown Processing: A suitable markdown parser/renderer library

Implementation Details

Implement efficient file system access with appropriate permissions
Create a modular, maintainable code structure
Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
Handle large files and directories with proper performance optimizations
Implement proper error handling for file system operations

Additional Considerations

Consider implementing a plugin system for extending functionality
Add support for custom CSS for markdown preview
Implement file/folder search capabilities
Add version history or auto-backup features
Consider export options (PDF, HTML, etc.)
